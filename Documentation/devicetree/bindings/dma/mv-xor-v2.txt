* Marvell XOR v2 engines

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "marvell,mv-xor-v2"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length (two sets)
    the first set is the DMA registers
    the second set is the global registers
- dma-bus-width: DMA address bus width
- msi-parent: Phandle to the MSI-capable interrupt controller used for
  interrupts.
- clocks: One or more clock gating clocks to be used to enable DMA engine
  unit in the SoC.

Optional properties:
The below is relevant only if Marvell Userspace SDK (MUSDK) is in use:
- musdk-mode (bool): Indicates whether the device is to be controlled by musdk framework.
  In this case, the probe process of the device is skipped, in order not to create
  a contention with the user-space drivers.
  In some cases, when musdk mode is enabled, the device will be attached to a generic
  uio instance, and this is why its not marked as "status=disabled".
  For more info about attaching the device to generic-uio instance, see
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/uio/uio_pdrv_genirq.txt

Example:

	xor0@400000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mv-xor-v2";
		reg = <0x400000 0x1000>,
		      <0x410000 0x1000>;
		msi-parent = <&gic_odmi>;
		clocks = <&gateclk 14>;
		dma-coherent;
		dma-width = <40>;
	};


	/* musdk-mode enabled example */
	xor0@400000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mv-xor-v2";
		reg = <0x400000 0x1000>,
		      <0x410000 0x1000>;
		msi-parent = <&gic_odmi>;
		clocks = <&gateclk 14>;
		dma-coherent;
		musdk-mode;
		uio-name = "uio_dma_xor_0";
		dma-width = <40>;
	};
